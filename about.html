               <div class="abt-answer">
               <p>After sharing her own car for a decade, Janet Murphy launched a carshare at Arboretum Cohousing, a 40 household intentional community. She likes to say she has been car-free since 2021, but really she has three cars that she shares with 15 neighbors as part of CoCar Inc. Janet also manages the International Cohousing Carshare Group, which has 110 members in five countries. It is ironic that Janet is all about cars now, as everyone knows she has never had any affection for cars or driving. She is happy to reduce the number of cars in the world and promote sharing our lives by helping to establish community carshares like Isthmus Carshare.</p>
